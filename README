Yet Another RPG - A project to develop a simple, RPG-style turn-based battle system.
Original code by Michael Carr.
Originally programmed in TI-BASIC (TI-83/84 families).

This is a simple project to port the original game code to a mainstream programming
language on standard PCs, such as C or Python. Whether it remains confined to 
just a single, one-on-one battle is a question for far down the line.

Anyone is free to copy and modify the source code, or build derivatives from it. Have fun.
